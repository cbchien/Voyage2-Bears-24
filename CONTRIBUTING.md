# Collaboration Guide
## About commiting to Master
* Branches get merged into master once reviewed
* No direct commits to Master, unless Hotfixes
## Milestones
### Projects
* Add a new task providing a descriptive short title of its purpose
* Convert the task into an issue and add the correct tags:
	1. Front-end - Changes will be made in Front-end code
	2. Back-end - Changes will be made in Back-end code
	3. Feature - Adds a new feature
	4. Fix - Fixes an existing problem
	5. Task - Not a feature nor a fix (e.g. Specify NodeJS version in Package.json)
	6. Invalid - If an issue is duplicated, it's marked as invalid and closed
* Choose the milestone for the issue (e.g: Sprint #1 or Sprint #2)
* Use the provided template in the Project Board to describe the issue
* If you decide to work on an active open task, assign yourself to the task
* When you start working on a task, move it from "Backlog" to "In Progress" in the Project Board
* Once the task is completed, move it from "In Progress" to "Code Review"
* Once the task has been reviewed, if no merge conflicts and acceptance criteria was fullfiled, the task will be moved to "Done" and closed. Otherwise, it will be reopened and moved back to "backlog"

### Branch Naming Convention
Use the following:
`tag/S[Number of Sprint]-[Issue ID]--[short-description]`

* **tag:** fix, feat, task, or hotfix
* **Number of Sprint:** If the tasks belong to "Sprint #1", then Number of Sprint is 1
* **Issue ID:** It is automatically generated by Github
* **short-description:** 2 to 4 words separated by `-` char

For example:
* `fix/S1-001--webpack-loader-typo`
* `feat/S1-002--login-slack`
* `task/S1-003--npm-script-clean-build`

### Writing commit messages
* Use first person verbs
* It's composed by three parts:
	* Shortlog - (< 78 chars) Starts with capital letter and doesn't add a trailing period. Includes a tag and/or scope that explains what was changed. Additionally, includes the task ID you are working on. Then, has a short description
	* Commit body - (Add new line after < 78 chars) Optional, if the shortlog doesn't explain enough. If complex changes were made, explain the reason for the changes

#### Examples:

Simple, self-explanatory:
```(git-commit)
task(package.json) #1: Include socket.io as dependency
```

Modifying several files and includying a commit body:
```(git-commit)
feat(index.js, routes.js) back-end #2: Add route handler for path "/public"

A Route Handler function was added to routes.js, to handle requests
for "/public" path, and exported. Imports routes.js in index.js to use
as middleware.
